    <h1>A poem</h1>
    <h2>Daedal by A.E STALLINGS</h2>
    <p>To build a labyrinth it takes<br>
        A twisted mind, a puzzled art,<br>
        A fractal branching of mistakes.</p>
    <p>Drag out the shovels and the rakes,<br>
        The spirit level, sacred chart.<br>
        To build a labyrinth it takes</p>
    <p>Shadows, stones, a way that snakes<br>
        And ladders to its shaky start;<br>
        An average mazing of mistakes,</p>
    <p>The kind that everybody makes,<br>
        Set random intervals apart.<br>
        To build a labyrinth it takes</p>
    <p>Dead ends that seem like lucky breaks,<br>
        The paths of bats that weave and dart<br>
        Through limestone caverns of mistakes.</p>
    <p>The shaken Etch A Sketch awakes<br>
        A lost child buried in its heart.<br>
        To build a labyrinth it takes<br>
        Some good intentions, some mistakes.</p>
